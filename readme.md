I have finished [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVU3V0A05k8&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhwBToawjm9faF1ixePexft-).

For an overview of the skills I have picked up, see [the gallery project](https://github.com/thomashoddinott/teaching-myself-php/tree/master/00_creating_a_gallery) I created (lessons 63-65 from the tutorial).

**Why commit your progress?**

Similar to the (psychology?) behind of [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

If you want to learn something and form new positive habits, then small, but consistent chunks over a longer period of time beat doing some one-off 20-hour course over the weekend. 

This applies to any new skill you want to acquire or goal you've set for yourself.

Making yourself socially accountable—committing to github in the case of code—is a great way to motivate you and your peers. It improves the likelihood seeing things out to completion.
