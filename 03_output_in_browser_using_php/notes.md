set php.exe in vscode (for error handling)

https://webstoked.com/fix-cannot-validate-php-vs-code/

added `"php.validate.executablePath": "C:/xampp/php/php.exe"` to `settings.json` 

In php you can still write html.

Just start using`<?php` to open and `?>` to close off your php 

get the `PHP Intelephense` extension in vscode for php code completion. Auto closes tags, etc. 

you can print text with both `echo` and `print`, `echo` is faster, if that's an issue for you
