I am running this on localhost with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

[./database.sql](./database.sql) contains the schema and some dummy data to populate the gallery.

[./test-upload/](./test-upload) contains some images to test the upload functionality.

**How the gallery looks on my machine when I add the files in `test-upload`:**
